# Oringo Client Universal Crack

## Information
This program allows you to use any version of Oringo Client Supporter without being whitelisted in any way. This will work for any future version unless Oringo decides to change the whitelist method (probably not, but if he does, I'll promptly update this crack).

## Requirements
- Our crack jar
- Oringo Client Supporter jar (get it yourself lmao)
- 2 iq

## Installation & Usage
- Open a shell with administrator permissions (either Powershell or Command Prompt) and find your loopback internet adapter's IDX (in the first column) with `netsh int ip sh int`.
- With that same admin shell, execute `netsh int ip add addr [your loopback adapter's idx] 172.105.246.181/32 st=ac sk=tr`. This will block the server's IP address and loop it back to localhost.
- Move both jars to the mods folder.
- Run Minecraft.


## FAQ

\
A: There is no need to block the rat, since there is no actual connection to the server.\
\
**Q: iS tHiS a RaT?**\
\
A: read the source???\
\
**Q: Can I use it with version [insert random version]?**\
\
A: You probably can, but unless it's specifically stated in this README, Oringo might've changed the authentication process, making the crack unusable.
